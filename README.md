## What is remitter?  
  
Remitter is a web application designed for International Money Remittance operators, more specifically those that send remittances to Venezuela from elsewhere in the world. It handles remittance transactions, client and provider management, payments and reporting.  

It was developed under the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) using the [CakePHP framework](https://cakephp.org/) and the [Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap-dashboard) template.

A dump of the database schema, ready for import, is located in the [config/remitter.sql](https://github.com/fx2000/remitter/blob/master/config/remitter.sql) file. You can use "admin" and "123456" to log into the system for the first time.
